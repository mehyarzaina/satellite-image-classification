# satellite-image-classification
The project aims to develop deep learning models that can classify remote sensing (RS) satellite images (collecting earth images without physical contact) into four categories: cloudy, desert, green area, and water.  The model should process input satellite images, identify visual patterns, and correctly assign each image to its category.
